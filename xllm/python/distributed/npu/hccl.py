"""HCCL collectives with a bounded current-stream all-reduce fast path.

Buffers must be contiguous and nonempty. AllGather also accepts aligned,
whole 2D FRACTAL_NZ storage; other collectives require ND. The caller must retain
the group and buffers through completion and graph replay. Direct capture
requires ``HCCL_OP_EXPANSION_MODE=AIV``. Large all-reduces use c10d's managed
communication stream because HCCL can select multi-stream AI CPU expansion
despite that environment setting.
